# Demo Application

This application showcases various features of the Dashjoin Platform.
To install it, you can use the upload feature on the configuration 
database (/resource/config/dj-database/dj%2Fconfig) or copy the files into
your model folder manually.

The demo includes the northwind sample database. The import scripts are already
included in the binaries and can be loaded into the database using the 
the initScripts configuration field (see the definition in model/dj-database).
