# Platform as a Service

Dashjoin offers a fully managed Platform as a Service available at <https://my.dashjoin.com/>.

## Tenant User Dashboard

In the Dashjoin cloud, users can authenticate via OpenID. The tenant user dashboard allows you to control who has access to your Dashjoin tenant. Once a user requests access, his or her record shows up on this page. Once you set the active flag, they are allowed to login. Using this page, you can also assign which roles a user should be in. Specifically, it is possible to promote users to be co-administrators of the tenant.
