## Creating a local Admin User

After installing Dashjoin, no user is set up in the system (a user can be defined via the environment variables - see below for more information).
To set up the local development admin user, navigate to <http://localhost:8080/#/setup>.

Choose a name, a username, and the password.

Example: Name `Local Admin`, username `admin`, password `My.secure.pass!`

Note:

this only works the very first time! After a development admin is created, no more local users can be created from the UI.

To change or disable the local user, please edit or delete the files `djroles.properties` and `djusers.properties` in the application root directory. [Here are more details on local users](#local-users)

The Dashjoin authentication is configured to allow log in using social Google or Github accounts, or to allow registration of users by e-mail and password (authentication via e-mail uses the Google Firebase authentication).

[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xmFRwhbAFA) for a demo video.

## Local users

Local users are maintained in the files `djusers.properties` and `djroles.properties`.

As the purpose for local users is for setup + dev, there is no management UI.
To create / update users, or change the pwd, the corresponding entries have to be changed there.

Passwords need to be [specified as hash of](#how-to-calculate-the-password-hash)
`username:Dashjoin:password`

Follow these steps to add/change a local user:
### 1. Add the user's password to `djusers.properties`

Important - hash the password salted with username + realm "Dashjoin":
For user "myuser" and password "mypass", need hash of `myuser:Dashjoin:mypass`

For this example the result is `a3f1c2e80af79503cef46f9e198919d3` (see [how to calculate below](#how-to-calculate-the-password-hash))

So we need to add this line to `djusers.properties`:
```
myuser=a3f1c2e80af79503cef46f9e198919d3
```

### 2. Add the user's role(s) to `djroles.properties`
To give "myuser" the "authenticated" role, add this line to `djroles.properties`:
```
myuser=authenticated
```
Multiple roles can be added with comma separation

### How to calculate the password hash

* Linux/MacOS:
```
echo -n "myuser:Dashjoin:mypass" | md5sum -
```

* Windows:
```
powershell Write-Host -NoNewline "myuser:Dashjoin:mypass" >temp.txt
powershell (Get-FileHash -algorithm md5 temp.txt).Hash.ToLower()
del temp.txt
```
need to store the string in a file temp.txt first (please delete after). Make sure there are no additional spaces and newlines

* Online:

For test/dev purposes you can also use an online service like <https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/md5.html>

Note this might be insecure if the online service stores or re-publishes the entered strings!

## Opening the Dashjoin application

To access the application, navigate to <http://localhost:8080>

## Docker

The official container image ```dashjoin/platform``` is hosted on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dashjoin/platform)

```bash
docker pull dashjoin/platform
docker run -p 8080:8080 dashjoin/platform
```

Point your browser to <http://localhost:8080>.

If you would like to make the registered databases and credentials persistent, you can mount the "model" folder:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v PERSISTENT_FOLDER:/deployments/model dashjoin/platform
```

## Run local Dashjoin installation as service

If you have installed Dashjoin locally and want to run the application as a service,
here are links on how to set up the service (not supported for production):

- [Windows](https://download.dashjoin.com/dashjoin/support/windows/)
- [Linux](https://automationrhapsody.com/install-java-application-linux-service/) (link to external site)

## Environment

Dashjoin uses the [Quarkus configuration framework](https://quarkus.io/guides/config-reference).
A Dashjoin instance can be configured using the following environment variables:

* DJ_ADMIN_USER: admin user name (defaults to "admin")
* DJ_ADMIN_PASS: admin password (default is blank)
* DJ_ADMIN_ROLES: initial admin roles (defaults to the "admin" role)
* DASHJOIN_HOME: defines the dashjoin working directory (defaults to /deployments/model when using docker or the directory where the platform was launched). If you are using a platfrom executable or installer version, the working directory is set to userhome/.dashjoin and cannot be modified
* DASHJOIN_APPURL: optional git url where an app is cloned / pulled from

By default, the service will be bound to 0.0.0.0 (all IP addresses) and serve HTTP on port 8080.

For configuring HTTP ports, keystores etc. please refer to the [Quarkus HTTP reference](https://quarkus.io/guides/http-reference).
The following example shows how to change the HTTP port using the windows executable:

```bash
> set QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=3333
> Dashjoin.exe
```

## How to enable HTTPS

Note:
in a production environment, very often a global load balancer (or other edge device) that serves HTTPS to the outside and connects
to the Dashjoin service using HTTP is used.

To enable HTTPS for the platform, the certificate file and the key file are required (usually called ```cert.pem``` and ```key.pem```).

Alternatively you can use a Java keystore, and you can also disable HTTP completely. Please refer to the [Quarkus HTTP reference](https://quarkus.io/guides/http-reference) for all configuration options.

Configure the service with the following settings:
```
QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE=/path/to/cert.pem
QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE=/path/to/key.pem
```

By default, the HTTPS port is 8443. To change it use:
```
QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_PORT=58443
```

### Self-signed certificate

For test + dev, you can create a self-signed certificate with the following command
```
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
```

## Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
CORS is enabled by default, with standard settings.

All configuration options are described in the [CORS filter section.](https://quarkus.io/guides/http-reference#cors-filter)

## Build Locally

Prerequisites:

* [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/) (11 or later)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (12 or later)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (3.6 or later)
* [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (11 or later)
* For Windows users: you need to create the symbolic link in "platform\dashjoin\src\main\resources\META-INF": `mklink /D resources ..\..\..\..\..\angular\dist\angular`

Dashjoin uses Quarkus as runtime framework (<https://quarkus.io>).
You can run your application in dev mode using:

```bash
platform/angular$ npm install [--legacy-peer-deps # required if nvm -version > 7.0!)
platform/angular$ ng build
platform$ mvn install
platform/dashjoin$ mvn compile quarkus:dev
```

Point your browser to <http://localhost:8080>.

You can use the provided launch file to directly run from within Eclipse (right-click on the launch file, "Run as" or "Debug as" -> "Dashjoin", 
note that you need to adjust your jdk, mvn, and working directory location in the file "Dashjoin.launch").
This requires the Eclipse Quarkus plugin (<https://quarkus.io/blog/eclipse-got-quarkused/>) and the Lombok
plugin (<https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse>) to be installed.
Launching with "Debug as" will also enable live coding mode.

The application can be packaged and installed locally using:
```bash
platform/dashjoin$ mvn package install
```

It produces the `dashjoin-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `/target` directory.
Be aware that itâ€™s not an _uber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

If you want to build an _uber-jar_, execute the following command:

```bash
platform/dashjoin$ mvn package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/dashjoin-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

### Eclipse

The Eclipse IDE can be used to develop and debug locally.
First install the [Eclipse Quarkus tools](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/quarkus-tools).

After cloning the Github repository, you need to import at least the following Maven projects into the Eclipse workspace:

* dashjoin
* dashjoin-core

Optional additional modules:
* dashjoin-demo
* dashjoin-kafka
* dashjoin-mongodb

The Maven dependencies need to be initialized with (right click dashjoin project folder) -> Maven -> Update Project.
The Angular UI must be built using the CLI, please refer to the previous section.

When everything was build successfully, you can use the Dashjoin.launch configuration to run or debug the platform.
The Quarkus launcher supports hot loading of resources, i.e. any changes made will be adjusted at runtime without having to restart the platform.
(Note: you will have to adjust the absolute folder references in the launch file to you own workspace settings)
